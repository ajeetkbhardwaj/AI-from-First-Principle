# MultiModel Learning

CLIP Model Evaluation onto the Test Dataset via following metrices R@1, R@5 and R@ for both Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image Retrival.
Please Note that i have trained the model 28 x 1072 images where 28 is the batch size and there are total batches. I have trained the model only for one epochs and also there are some some limitation there fore evaluation of the trained model did't performed well but if we train onto the better quality dataset and tune some training code for better peformance we can get desirable accuracy during training and evaluation time.

Image-to-Text Retrieval:
R@1: 0.0364 : Only 3.6 % is correctly identified out of 10 samples
R@5: 0.1806 : only 18 % correctly identified out of 10 samples
R@10: 0.3538 : Only 35 % correctly identified out of 10 samples.

Text-to-Image Retrieval:
R@1: 0.0358
R@5: 0.1782
R@10: 0.3580
